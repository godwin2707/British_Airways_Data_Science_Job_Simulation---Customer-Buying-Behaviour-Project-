# British_Airways_Data_Science_Job_Simulation - Customer-Buying-Behaviour-Project
This project focuses on building a predictive machine learning model to understand and forecast customer booking behavior. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can support strategic business decisions.

📊 Objective
Develop a robust classification model to:
Predict the likelihood of customer bookings
Identify key factors influencing booking behavior

🛠️ Project Workflow
Data Preparation
Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical data.
Performed exploratory data analysis to understand trends and patterns.
Model Building
Implemented a Random Forest Classifier for prediction.
Used Grid Search Cross-Validation to fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

Results:
Achieved a final model accuracy of 85.2% after tuning.
Performed feature importance analysis to identify the most influential attributes in predicting successful bookings.
Insights & Reporting

📌 Key Technologies
